# mini-projects

All my practice journey to becoming a Junior Front-End Developer.
Mini-projects made in a couple of hours only for my own practice and experiments.

Mainly using CSS, HTML and JavaScript but also their frameworks like React, Bootstrap, SASS, etc.

Hope you enjoy these even if there's not much work in them.
